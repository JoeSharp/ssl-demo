# Tech Demos

This repository contains small tech demos of specific development topics.

I am using this to build a library of small demonstrations that show how to interact with some specific bits of technology, outside of the complex context of any existing project.

The intent is to provide runnable demos which allow people to explore topics in a self contained way.

Most of these have been used to setup local development stacks, rather than provide a frame of reference for production ready platforms.

## ssl-demo

This explores how to setup SSL in a spring boot app, but it also provides scripts and examples of setting up nginx.

## networking-demo

This project explores the distinctions between Docker and Kubernetes networking.
